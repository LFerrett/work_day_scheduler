# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project creates a simple day planner that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. It also utilizes the Moment.js library to manipulate date and time. The final planner allows the user to input text into a time block and save that text. It displays the current date and time and also color codes the timeblocks based on whether it is the current block, or a past or future block.
